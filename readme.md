#Chatbot

A simple chatbot written in C. It is based on the fact that when we have a conversation our mind
just searches for the keywords and presents a suitable response or action to that sentence. 

The bot does the same, it reads the sentence, finds the keywords that are important and presents with a
reply. Hopefully, I would be able to write an intelligent bot that would be able to present a good conversation.

## Installation

Installation is very easy via `MakeFile':
Just run: 

```sh
make all
```
In order to remove, run:

```sh
make clean
```

## Usage

After running `make all` you get a binary named as `chat`. Just run `./chat` and start chatting with the bot.

## Credits & Inspiration

The basic idea is pretty much old and comes directly from previous bots written in many languages. The project
is just to scratch an itch and would mainly serve for learning purposes.
